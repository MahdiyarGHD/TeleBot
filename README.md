# TeleBot
A minimal tool for Telegram bot developers

## Installation
`composer require webpajooh/telebot`

## How to use

### Start point
We start by creating an instance of `TeleBot` class:

    try {
        $tg = new TeleBot('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
    } catch (Throwable $th) {...}

### Get the update object
There are short ways to access the `update` object and some important fields. I recommend you to read [the official documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) to understand these objects well.

    $tg->update
    $tg->message
    $tg->chat
    $tg->user

You also can use `hasCallbackQuery()` method, when you want to check if the `update` object has a `callback_query` field.

### Methods
Thanks to [magic methods](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php), we can use API methods without implementing them, and just call them by name and pass an array as parameter:

    $tg->editMessageText([...])

### Router
You may define some routes to your bot features; define them by `listen()` method:

    $tg->listen('/start', function () use ($tg) {
        $tg->sendMessage([
            'chat_id' => $tg->user->id,
            'text' => 'Hello, world!',
        ]);
    }, false);
    
The third parameter that is true by default, makes you able to terminate the script after running a command. In the previous example we passed `false` so script continues.

You can also get parameters and use them as variables:

    $tg->listen('set_age_%d', function ($age) use ($tg) {
        // TODO
    });

TeleBot translates them to regex, so it will be good to take a look at this table to know how to use them efficiently:

| Type |TeleBot| Regex |
|--|--|--|
| Digits | %d | (\d+) |
| String (Anything but a whitespace) | %s | (\S+) |
| Character | %c | (\S) |
| Everything including an empty string| %p | (.*) |

### Logger
Use this if you need to log something into a `log.txt` file:

    Logger::log($tg->user->id);
    tl($tg->user->id); // Does the same thing

### Keyboard
TeleBot includes two classes for making keyboards; `InlineKeyboard` and `ReplyKeyboard`. Here you see an example:

    $keyboard = (new InlineKeyboard())
        ->addCallbackButton('üìï Help', 'help_callback')
        ->addUrlButton('üì± Share', 'https://t.me/share/url?url=https://t.me/your_awesome_bot&text=Some text')
        ->chunk(1)
        ->rightToLeft()
        ->get();

Then use it like this:

    $tg->sendMessage([
	    // Other parameters
        'reply_markup' => $keyboard,
    ]);

Consider that `chunk()` method accepts multiple numbers as well! You may pass an array like [1, 3, 2] to build such a keyboard:  
<pre>
[        1        ]  
[ 2 ]  [ 3Ô∏è ]  [ 4 ]  
[   5   ] [   6   ]  
</pre>

### Extend it!
You may want to add some methods to TeleBot class to improve your code readability and avoid duplication. Look at this simple example as an inspiration:

    TeleBot::extend('isReply', function () {
        return property_exists($this->message, 'reply_to_message');
    });

    // if ($tg->isReply()) { ... }
